          <p className="background">
            When Surya Uday was incorporated, a Field Survey was done by us,
            covering children and old age people. During our survey, we found
            that many disabled children were not going to school and were
            lacking basic needs while getting neglected. The same issues were
            discussed with the officials of SSA verbally. During these
            discussions, we also found that, as per the last survey done by Sarv
            Siksha Abhiyan (SSA), there are more than 4000 special students in
            District Kangra only. In the case of special children, the
            government is doing its best to enroll most of the students for
            their benefit, but there are certain challenges like transportation,
            parents belonging to poor classes, they don’t have time to take them
            to school, and so on. That’s why Surya Uday Charitable Trust made
            its vision to work for Special Need Children with the objective to
            give qualitative life to them by teaching skills according to their
            abilities and interests. This will enable them to be part of
            society, survive dignifiedly and lead a better life.
